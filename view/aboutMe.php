            <p>My name is Melinda and I love to laugh. Dance parties are one of my very favorite things. I am a language teacher, an author, an artist, and a certified health specialist. Most people say I eat really gross food because I don't eat sugar. I can't blame them, but I love feeling healthy! God is my #1. I have always wanted to be a mom, and family is everything to me. I am from Washington State and I love the beach with my whole heart. But now I live in Arizona, and after complaining for 2 years about how much I hate it, I am starting to love it! I have the coolest husband who is my best friend. I believe if you surround yourself with your best friends, life will be good no matter how difficult it is.</p>
